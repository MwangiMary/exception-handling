## File Read & Write Challenge
This Python program demonstrates basic file handling and error management.
- It asks the user for a filename.
- Attempts to open and read the fileâ€™s contents.
- Prints the file content to the console.

Handles errors gracefully (e.g., file not found, permission issues).
